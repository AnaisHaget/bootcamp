[Griffin Chure](https://gchure.github.io/), a former Caltech graduate student, put together a skeleton repository called `reproducible_research` that can be used to organize scientific research projects. \n",
    "* Navigate to Griffin's template on your browser with [this link](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research). Click **\"Use this template\"** to create your new repository, give it a useful name (e.g. `2021_fsri_project`), and then clone it to your local machine.\n",

Create and update a `.gitignore` file to either ignore everything in `~/data` or file extensions that are specific to your data files (e.g. `*.csv`). Be sure to also commit your changes to the `.gitignore` file!"
