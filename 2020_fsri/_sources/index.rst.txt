FSRI: Introduction to Programming Bootcamp
==========================================

This bootcamp provides an intensive, hands-on, pragmatic introduction to computer programming. Many of the examples are aimed at biologists and bioengineers, but scientists and engineers of all disciplines will learn useful programming skills. No previous programming experience is assumed. Python is the language of instruction. Students will learn basic concepts such as data types, control structures, string processing, functions, input/output, etc., while writing code applied to scientific problems. At the end of the course, students will be able to write code and analyze and plot data.

For timing of the live-via-Zoom offering of the bootcamp, see the :ref:`schedule<Schedule overview>`. Enrollees will be emailed a Zoom link.
